# CodyChatBOT
CodyChatBOT is the first time I have attempted to make any chatbot. I use a .json file of data provided by myself to respond as Cody Rabie to preprocessed questions.  The program preprocesses the data.json file in the directory to provide answers to certain questions as myself (Cody). If it does not recognize user input it will provide the user input to blenderbot and return the answer. Each user question is saved in the conversation history as the user continues.
